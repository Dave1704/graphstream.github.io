GraphStream is a dynamic graph library written in Java that provides Java developers a way to easily represent dynamic graphs in memory, on screen or in files.

GraphStream provides a framework to handle the evolution of graphs, that is the changes on values stored on edges and nodes of a graph during time, but also the "topology" changes of the graph, that is the addition, removal and modification of nodes and edges during time.
