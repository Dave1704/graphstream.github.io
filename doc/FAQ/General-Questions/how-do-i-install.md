You can download the zip or tar.bz2 packages on the Download section of this website. This file contains a binary jar package and the API documentations. Point your classpath to these classes and you're done.

But the best way is to manage your project using Maven, adding gs-core as a dependency. See [GraphStream & Maven](/doc/Tutorials/GraphStream-Maven/).
