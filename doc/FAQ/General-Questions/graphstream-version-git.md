The GraphStream project is released with version numbers. We create a version each time we feel the project reaches a milestone. Versions are two numbers-based (0.4, 1.0, 2.45): a major number and a minor one. Changes in major number reflect major changes, milestones such as changes in the API and indicted a discontinuity with previous APIs. Changes in minor numbers may indicate new features or bug fixes but no compatibility disruption with your code.

The source code is maintained on a GIT repository at github.com. Refer to the [Source Repository](http://graphstream-project.org/doc/Source-Repository/) page for more details.
