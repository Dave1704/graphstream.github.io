Older versions of GraphStream provided only one implementation of graph that was supposed to fit all purposes. However as more use cases appeared, we felt it was necessary to provide several implementations adapted to various uses.

Therefore Graph is an interface that defines the common operations available on all graphs implementations provided by GraphStream.
